This is an Arduino library to emulate Alpines M-Bus which is used on a variety of car radios.
You can send and receive messages as well as send special messages which trick the radio in believing it communicates with an cd changer.

Feel free to add, copy and change the code as long as credit is given.

Electrically, you'd want to have a piece of circuitry to split the send and receive line which is shown here(not my website):
